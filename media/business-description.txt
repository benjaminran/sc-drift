SCDrift gamifies the performance of longboard maneuvers to create a sense of community centered around electric longboard brands. It enables companies that make electric longboards to maintain closer relationships with customers by establishing a channel of communication to reach riders during their day-to-day use of the board. In exchange, riders benefit from the channel by receiving gamified challenges and rewards.
